# New-Music-Reddit-Bot
Reddit bot that searches for music that fits your taste on r/listentothis. The bot looks at the top 15 hot posts and 
searches in the title for specific genres (list is in the code). It prints the title and link of the submission to a text file
and saves the post in your reddit account.
To automate the bot look in log.txt. Under "Automate" there are steps I took on automating the bot so it would collect music periodically.
