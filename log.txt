Creating reddit bot using PRAW and python

Downloaded PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start.html
https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html
	(in cmd prompt)
	pip install prawl

Want to create bot that will go on r/listentothis and browse the top
posts for the most popular links with a specific genre in mind.
The bot will record those posts and links into a text file.

The line

	submissions = reddit.subreddit('listentothis').hot(limit=10)

	Output: AttributeError: 'Subreddit' object has no attribute 'get_top'

was not working correctly, but the line below worked to get the hot posts
	
	submissions = reddit.subreddit('listentothis').hot(limit=10)


When running the bot encountered error 
	File "music_bot.py", line 54, in run_bot
    f.write(song.title)
	UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u2014' in position 10: ordinal not in range(128)

Needed to change encoding with these lines of code 
	# encoding=utf8
	import sys
	reload(sys)
	sys.setdefaultencoding('utf8')
